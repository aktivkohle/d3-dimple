So this is a more sensible re-make of the chart at http://flowingdata.com/2010/05/14/wait-something-isnt-right-here/ The jpg image of this also in this repository.

This chart is a depiction of perceived and actual substance use in a survey of 1000 students. The graphic is badly wrong, no change in the height of the bars with the change in numbers. They are trying to say that perceived is higher than actual, but ignoring the data. Even the zero height bars seem to have a height. A bar with 30.9% is higher than a bar of 56.9%, nothing seems to really add up to 100%. Well the alcohol numbers on the red bars come close adding to around 98%. 

I can't even understand the variable definitions. "actual" probably means the answer to "how frequently do you use?" while "perceived" is "how often do you believe the other students use?" 

real/perceived is the same idea as actual/perceived.

As far as making this data work nicely with a dimple.js visualisation, it was necessary to put it into "tall" format (as it is described in R). A few useful links towards the end of the html file.
